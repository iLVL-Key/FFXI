# Leaderboard
Tracks battle information and groups it together in different "leaderboards" for the party.

**NOT COMPLETE - Under current development**

### Currently Tracked Leaderboards
- Cure - Running total of cures (up to 3 places)
- Death - Running total of deaths (up to 3 places)
- Highscore - Highest individual WS damage (up to 5 places)
- Kill - Running total of kills (up to 3 places)
- Lowscore - Lowest individual WS damage (up to 3 places)
- Nuke - Running total of nukes (up to 5 places)
- Whiffs - Running total of whiffs (up to 3 places)

With the exception of the Death and Kill Leaderboards, information is pulled via packets so chat filters will not affect data collection.  
The Cure and Nuke Leaderboards account for aoe's.
