# Emotes
Expands upon the games built-in emotes.

Uses "single slash" commands just like the built-in emotes so they feel more natural to use.  
Can tell the difference between targeting nothing/yourself, another player, a monster, an npc, and an object.  
You can change the default preferred pronoun near the top of the file, or change it at any time with a command
```
--------------------
--Pronoun Override--
local pronoun = 'b' --b/m/f/t ([b]uiltin determined by the game, [m]ale, [f]emale, [t]hey/them)
--------------------
```
