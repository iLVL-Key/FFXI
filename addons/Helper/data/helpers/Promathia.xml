        <capped_job_points>Your Job Points have reached their limit... and still, you wish for more.</capped_job_points>
        <capped_merit_points>Your Merit Points are full. And yet, what has truly changed?</capped_merit_points>
        <flavor_text>
            <1>Your struggle is meaningless... yet still you fight.</1>
            <2>The world decays, and you are but a fading ember.</2>
            <3>No matter how bright the dawn, the night will return.</3>
            <4>Seek strength, gain power... it will not spare you from fate.</4>
            <5>You run from oblivion, yet it is all that awaits you.</5>
            <6>The eternal cycle persists, indifferent to your efforts.</6>
            <7>All things will break, all things will fall, all things will be forgotten.</7>
            <8>You would defy me? You cannot even defy time.</8>
            <9>Even the most glorious victories are but a breath against eternity.</9>
            <10>Stay your course if you wish... but nothing waits beyond the end.</10>
            <11>Seek comfort in your allies, your friends... they, too, will be taken by the void.</11>
            <12>The world moves in cycles... and you are merely another turn of the wheel.</12>
            <13>Hope? There is no hope. There is only the inevitable end.</13>
            <14>Your achievements will crumble like dust upon the wind.</14>
            <15>Do you believe you are different? That you can *change* fate?</15>
            <16>Even light is but a flicker before it is consumed.</16>
            <17>There is no meaning, no path, no purpose. Only the endless return to nothingness.</17>
            <18>You cling to life like a leaf upon the river, hoping to resist the current.</18>
            <19>It is not cruelty, nor hatred, nor wrath. It is simply what must be.</19>
            <20>Still you fight, still you wish to exist? Foolish, but... entertaining.</20>
            <21>You are but a mote of dust in the storm, and the storm will not be stayed.</21>
            <22>You stand against the void, but in time, it will consume you.</22>
            <23>All victories fade, all triumphs crumble, all lives end.</23>
            <24>You carve your name into history... but history forgets.</24>
            <25>A thousand battles, a thousand wars... none of it matters.</25>
            <26>Light, darkness - it is all the same in the end.</26>
            <27>Your journey has a destination, whether you see it or not.</27>
            <28>Even the stars will one day die. What makes you think you will not?</28>
            <29>A legacy? A lasting mark? Nothing you build will stand forever.</29>
            <30>You struggle, you fight, and for what? A moment of respite before the inevitable.</30>
            <31>The void does not hunger. It simply is.</31>
            <32>You are dust, held together for but a fleeting moment.</32>
            <33>The gods do not protect you. They merely watch as you fade.</33>
            <34>It is not cruelty, nor punishment. Only the certainty of oblivion.</34>
            <35>You hold your weapon tightly, as if it will stop what is coming.</35>
            <36>No magic, no steel, no strength will outlast time itself.</36>
            <37>Everything you cherish will one day be lost.</37>
            <38>Why do you fight? You already know how this ends.</38>
            <39>The end does not rush toward you. It simply waits for you to arrive.</39>
