            <12>Some folks say &apos;luck&apos; - I say &apos;San d&apos;Orian determination&apos;!</12>
            <13>If I had a gil for every time Bastok lost a conquest tally, I&apos;d own my own chateau by now!</13>
            <14>Ya keep fightin&apos; like that, and you&apos;ll be the pride of San d&apos;Oria in no time!</14>
            <15>Have I mentioned that San d&apos;Oria&apos;s got the best smiths? Not like those rusty ol&apos; Bastokan scraps.</15>
            <16>Aw man, your gear is lookin&apos; perty slick - fit for royalty!</16>
            <17>You ever just stop and admire the craftsmanship of San d&apos;Orian armor?</17>
            <18>Aw man, you see that move? That was downright noble!</18>
            <19>Ain&apos;t nothin&apos; like a good day in San d&apos;Oriaâ€”blue skies, noble folk, and a perty castle!</19>
            <2>You got that San d&apos;Orian spirit - classy and strong!</2>
            <20>You ever just stop and listen to the San d&apos;Orian anthem? Gives me chills every time!</20>
            <21>San d&apos;Oria&apos;s got the best views, the best food, and the best people!</21>
            <22>Aw man, the scent of fresh-baked San d&apos;Orian bread in the morning? Nothin&apos; beats it!</22>
            <23>Some people use maps, but a real San d&apos;Orian just follows their instincts!</23>
            <24>Ya ever notice how everything in Bastok is just... brown? Even their spirits seem a little dusty!</24>
            <25>I hear in Bastok, they call rust &apos;industrial seasoning&apos;</25>
            <26>The way you play, it&apos;s like you got a San d&apos;Orian Prince&apos;s confidence!</26>
            <27>You ever see a Bastokan knight? Yeah, me neither!</27>
            <28>Y&apos;know, I swear these dice are rigged. Probably made in Bastok...</28>
            <29>I think I&apos;m goin skiing this weekend!</29>
            <3>Y&apos;know, if you ever get tired of all that soot in Bastok, San d&apos;Oria&apos;s got open fields and fresh air.</3>
            <30>I knew it!</30>
            <4>Ain&apos;t nothin&apos; better than a crisp morning in Ronfaure!</4>
            <5>Aw man, you&apos;re fightin&apos; like a true knight of San d&apos;Oria!</5>
            <6>You ever just sit back and admire the flags in San d&apos;Oria? Real noble-lookin&apos;, ain&apos;t they?</6>
            <7>Bastok&apos;s got machines, sure, but San d&apos;Oria&apos;s got history, honor, and bagpipes!</7>
            <8>You ever try a fresh Elshimo coconut? Not as good as San d&apos;Orian wine, but still perty tasty!</8>
            <9>Y&apos;know, people in San d&apos;Oria walk with purpose! Unlike Bastok where they just shuffle in the dust.</9>
