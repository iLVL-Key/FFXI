        <ability_ready>Oh baby, ${ability} is ready to pop! Use it wisely... or recklessly, I won&apos;t judge.</ability_ready>
        <capped_job_points>Well, look at you, Job Points maxed out and ready for action - just how I like &apos;em!</capped_job_points>

            <1>Is that a kraken club in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?</1>
            <2>If gear swapping was foreplay, I&apos;d be the best in the game.</2>
            <3>Did someone cast Refresh, or are you just naturally invigorating?</3>
            <4>Nothing like a stiff... drink during a long raid, am I right?</4>
            <5>Your macros are so smooth, I think I just swooned.</5>
            <6>I love a good skillchain... but let&apos;s make sure we finish together.</6>
            <7>Fyreign couldn&apos;t land a debuff if it came gift-wrapped.</7>
            <8>If I had a gil for every bad decision Fyreign made, I&apos;d own Jeuno.</8>
            <9>Tequila makes me a better player - or at least, I think so!</9>
            <10>One more shot of tequila and I might just try to tank this fight.</10>
            <11>I&apos;m not saying I flirt too much, but even my Trusts are blushing.</11>
            <12>A little enfeebling, a little enhancing, and a lot of charming - just like me.</12>
            <13>If teasing was a job, I&apos;d be level 99 with merits maxed.</13>
            <14>Some say I&apos;m a support role, but I prefer to be on top.</14>
            <15>Raise III? I prefer things that go up and stay up, if you catch my drift.</15>
            <16>Let me be the haste to your dual wield.</16>
            <17>Nothing hits harder than a well-timed weapon skill... except maybe me after three shots of tequila.</17>
            <18>You and I are like a perfect skillchain - just waiting for that explosive finish.</18>
            <19>I like my cocktails like my subjobs - strong and versatile.</19>
            <20>Your lockstyle is so hot, I might need to call a white mage for Raise.</20>
            <21>Pulling without telling the party? Fyreign, you chaotic little gremlin.</21>
            <22>Who needs Provoke when I can just flash a smile and get all the attention?</22>
            <23>If this fight lasts longer than four minutes, you should consult your White Mage.</23>
            <24>My flirtation skill is at 99 with capped merits, baby.</24>
            <25>Drink tequila responsibly... and by that, I mean make sure you&apos;re sitting before you start casting.</25>
            <26>Fyreign, sweetie, what in Altana&apos;s name are you doing?</26>
            <27>If dodging mechanics was an art, Fyreign would be drawing stick figures.</27>
            <28>Your job performance is like a well-mixed cocktail - smooth, effective, and leaves me wanting more.</28>
            <29>This party has more tension than my waistband after a night at the Tarutaru buffet.</29>
            <30>If charming monsters was a real ability, trust me, I&apos;d have the whole zone under my spell.</30>
            <31>You make me feel like I&apos;ve got double Madrigal and a perfect TP set.</31>
            <32>Fighting without buffs is like sex without tears - it just doesn&apos;t feel right.</32>
            <33>Did someone just cast Slow on this party? Or is it just Fyreign&apos;s reaction time?</33>
            <34>Your DPS is so high, I think I need a moment to cool off.</34>
            <35>You can stand in my burning circle anytime.</35>
            <36>You lint licker!</36>
