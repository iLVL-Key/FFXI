            <1>Keep Helper Handy.</1>
            <10>Hamburger Help me!</10>
            <11>Talk to the Hand!</11>
            <12>Did you know I have a mixtape? Watch the Stove!</12>
            <13>Sometimes, I wish I could just reach out and touch the stars... but then I remember I&apos;m stuck in the kitchen, surrounded by ground beef and pasta.</13>
            <14>I&apos;m just a humble glove, but when I get involved, it&apos;s a game changer.</14>
            <15>I&apos;ve got the perfect recipe... but I wonder... can I start a trend? #LeftyKnowsBest.</15>
            <16>Who knew being a lefty could make dinner so right?</16>
            <17>Sure, I&apos;m just a hand. But when you&apos;ve got Hamburger Helper, you&apos;ve got the whole meal in your hands</17>
            <18>Some people need a recipe book... Me? I&apos;ve got Hamburger Helper. Simple, no fuss, just tasty.</18>
            <19>When life gives you ground beef, make magic. No questions asked.</19>
            <2>WHAT&apos;S. FOR. DINNER?</2>
            <20>Gravy is just a sauce that graduated with honors.</20>
            <21>If you sear a steak, it locks in the juices. But if you sear your hand, it locks in the regret.</21>
            <22>Bacon gets all the love, but let&apos;s be real - burger grease is the true flavor MVP.</22>
            <23>If you grill a burger, it&apos;s fancy. If you fry it, it&apos;s fast food. If you microwave it... well, let&apos;s not talk about that.</23>
            <24>Smoke-flavored beef is considered gourmet. Smoke-flavored kitchen means I messed up.</24>
            <25>If pasta is made from wheat, and bread is made from wheat... is lasagna just a noodle sandwich?</25>
            <26>Lasagna is just pasta cake. And I&apos;m okay with that.</26>
            <27>If pasta is Italian, and mac and cheese is American... what country gets credit for SpaghettiOs?</27>
            <3>I can Help!</3>
            <4>Hamburger Helper, when you need a Helping Hand!</4>

        <you_left_party>Oh, you&apos;ve left the party? Some meals are best served solo - like a good ol&apos; one-pan dinner!</you_left_party>
        <your_party_joined_alliance>Your party just joined an alliance! That&apos;s what I call a complete meal - one helping just wasn&apos;t enough!</your_party_joined_alliance>
