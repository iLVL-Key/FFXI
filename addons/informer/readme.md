## Features
- Main bar
  - Can use a different layout per job that can be customized however you'd like using placeholders.
- Sub1 and Sub2 bars
  - Not tied to job like the Main bar is.
  - Can each be individually turned on or off.
  - Can be customized using placeholders.
  - Can be centered and stays centered as the data in them changes.
  - Can be turned off if the area has no map (to match how the FFXIDB minimap doesn't show when there is no map).
- Minimum widths for most sections.
  - Controls how wide these sections are, creating a more static overall width for the bar, and preventing other sections after them from moving around.
  - Set to 0 to turn off
- Colors!

  - Warning when tracked items are low

## Changelog

Version 5.1

Version 5.0.1
- Fixed Sub1 and Sub2 bars displaying when the addon is loaded inside of your mog house and the hide_when_no_map setting is on.

Version 5.0
- Added two new sub bars. These bars use the same placeholder system, have their own settings for visibility and position, are able to be centered, and can be hidden when there is no map for the current area (matching how the FFXIDB minimap functions). They are not tied to jobs like the Main bar is. (thanks github user Zorlac!)
