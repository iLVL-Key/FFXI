## How To Setup
1. Load the addon with `//lua load bars`.
2. Type `//bars ui` and follow the guide from there.
3. Once you have the bar positions settled, you can add or remove any of the Player Stats bars using `//bars hp` (where 'hp' can be replaced with 'mp', 'tp', or 'pet' to add/remove those bars instead). Remember that the "player stat" bars displayed are specific to the job you are currently on.

#### Extra
4. You can type `//bars help` at any time to display the list of in game commands the addon supports. See **Commands** below.
5. If you have a different number of the Player Stats bars shown for different jobs and would like them aligned to the bottom (for example, sitting on top of your chat log), you can adjust the vertical offset for each bar for each job as needed in the `data/settings.xml` file.
6. Explore the `data/settings.xml` file to see the full list of options that are available to tweak. See **Options** below.

## Known Issues
- The name of a weapon skill used by a player being blinked by an enemy will be displayed incorrectly as a job ability.
- Bar dragging does not work properly if Window Mode is set to "Window" in Windower. It seems the height of the window's title bar is included when Windower returns the position of the mouse, but is not included when determing the position of a text object on screen, resulting in the numbers not quite matching up and needing to grab slightly below where the actual bar is on the screen in order to grab and drag it.
- The Target Lock icons/underline very rarely will display incorrectly. A simple reload of the addon (`//lua r bars`) should fix the issue. I have done what I can to prevent this from happening, but `:extents()` occasionally just doesn't cooperate ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Changelog
Version 4.3.1
- Fixed Aggro List not accounting for pets of players in your party/alliance.

Version 4.3
- Added new Aggro List section and related settings. Displays a list of monsters currently aggressive to you and your party/alliance.
- Added `aggro/agg` command. Toggles the Aggro List.
- Added new debuff icons for tracking Cumulative Magic boosts.
- Added `show_bar` option to the Self Action section.
- Added `show_results` options to the Party Actions sections.
- Adjusted the Monster Target to account for monsters that are first targeted by a player (ie pulled).
- Adjusted the `help` command text to be more organized.
- Added Stygian Sphere (Caturai) to list of moves that remove all debuffs.
- Fixed Poisonga I/II not applying Poison I/II debuff icon to targets
- Fixed (hopefully all of) the debuff icons Summoner Avatar debuff Blood Pacts. There are still some that do damage with an additional effect that are unable to be directly confirmed to have landed that are not accounted for.
- Fixed Arcane Crest showing up as Hydrohelix in the debuff icons.
- Fixed errors in Besieged/Mireu (high lag areas).

Version 4.2
- Added `show_monster_target` options for Focus Target, Sub Target, and Target sections. Displays the last known target of the monster.
- Added `monster_target` icon. Used with the `show_monster_target` options.
- Added `flip_doom_timer_coloring` option. Flips the timer coloring for the `Doom` debuff so that it changes from red when it first lands, to orange, then green when it is under 10 seconds.
- Added `data/durations.lua` file. Used to define known durations for specific players.
- Added a Tracking Index number to all debuffs so that in the event of a debuff with a set duration being overwritten/renewed it is not removed early when the original duration expires.
- Added debuff `duration_cap` option. Limits the maximum time a debuff will stay displayed on a target when a specific duration is not known.
- Added new debuff icons: Impact, Carnage Elegy, Threnodies, Requiems, boosted Elemental DOT Debuffs (Burn, Rasp, etc).
- Adjusted how Corsair Elemental Shots affect debuffs. Now adds a `+` symbol to the debuff icon when it gets boosted by an Elemental Shot. Boosted Dia and Bio are now correctly identified instead of incorrectly increasing their tier on the icon.
- Adjusted all debuffs to have a max duration before they are automatically removed. Max duration for debuffs from abilities whose durations are from players who do not have their durations defined in the data/durations.lua file are specific to that ability. Max duration for debuffs from spells whose durations are from players who do not have their durations defined in the data/durations.lua file are capped at the duration_cap number.
- Adjusted `show_monster_level` option into each Focus Target, Sub Target, and Target section instead of one option covering all three sections.
- Adjusted action targets to better account for AOE actions and specifying the main target of the AOE. This should help eliminate instances where a mob performs an AOE move and the target of the move seems to be incorrectly named as a random one of the targets hit. To be clear, this is still not 100% perfect, but should be correct more often now.
- Fixed Diaga not applying Dia to targets.
- Fixed the action `cancelled` icon from displaying by itself for certain monster actions that are paralyzed.

Version 4.1.1
- Fixed icon file check so that it correctly does not display a blank white icon if the file does not exists. Previously only made the check if the spell cast was a tier 2+ (had a roman numeral attached at the end).

Version 4.1
- Added `debuff_icons` and `debuff_timers` options. Will display icons/timers for debuffs on monsters.
  - This feature IS NOT 100% accurate. There is currently no way to directly see and track buffs/debuffs on monsters.
  - Timers are based on minimum durations and will turn into a "??" once it reaches zero and we have not received a "debuff wears off" message.
  - You will not receive a "debuff wears off" message for debuffs that another player has landed on a monster.
  - There is no way to account for any duration gear that other players have when they land debuffs.
- Added `show_monster_level` option. Shows a monster's level on the Focus Target, Sub Target, and Target bars. Shares space with Dynamis Jobs which takes priority. Uses Wide Scan to retrieve monster levels and will scan at a random interval between every 30 and 60 seconds only when the player is active (determined by changing targets). In regards to Limbus mobs and their adjusting levels, keep in mind mobs will adjust their level immediately when they are aggroed, but the level displayed in Bars will only update once the scan happens again.
  - Tracking a target via the in-game Wide Scan function will prevent further Wide Scans for monster levels until either the tracked target dies or the track is removed.
- Added `ui_bg` options to the Focus Target, Sub Target, Target, and Self Action sections. Adds a gradient shadow behind the text for these bars to help readability.
- Added the `bottom_up` option to the `party_1_actions` section. Determines if the party list goes from the bottom up (true) or top down(false) as members are added to the party. Added for those who use the XIVParty addon and have their party list go from top down. (thanks xenodeus!)
- Added `truncate` icon option.
- Added a number of `stroke_alpha`, `stroke_width`, and `stroke_color` settings to the different bar sections.
- Added `hide_pet_bar_when_no_pet` option. Hides the pet bar when set to be displayed but no pet is present.
- Added `hide_player_stats_bars_when_no_target` option. Hides any Player Stat bars set to be displayed when there is no current target.
- Adjusted how the `abbreviate_common_mob_names` option works. Now pulls the names and their abbreviations from the `data/mob_abbreviations.lua` file. This allows the user to edit, add, or remove abbreviations as they see fit.
- Added Temenos and Apollyon mobs to the default list of common names abbreviated by the `abbreviate_common_mob_names` option.
- Added additional checks to help prevent the Target Lock and UI BG from displaying incorrectly.
- Adjusted the bg_alpha of the bar meters and bar drain meters so that their combined alpha equals the actual bg_alpha number in settings (since they are overlapped).
- Adjusted the Target Lock coloring to match the target color.
- Fixed an issue with the Bar Drain effect for the Pet bar not going back to the correct alpha after Bar Fade.
- Fixed an issue with the Pet bar flickering when faded.
- Fixed Focus Target, Sub Target, Player Stats HP, Player Stats MP, and Player Stats Pet Bar Drain animation not working as intended.
- Fixed issues with zoning while Screen Test is active
- Fixed an issue with using Food when already full resulting in the Self Action "action failed" meter showing by itself and getting stuck until the player performs another action.

Version 4.0
- Overhauled how Auto Focus target data is saved. Now saves as a lua table in separate `data/auto_focus_targets.lua` file instead of saving as xml data inside the settings file. This approach allows for much easier handling of target names. No need to convert names with spaces and apostrophes to a format that xml can parse, instead saved as a direct string key exactly how it should be spelled.
- Overhauled many of the options in the settings file. Many names adjusted for clarity. New settings added for things that used to be hard-coded. Some settings have had their structure/layout adjusted.
- Added Bar Pulse animation options. Will pulse the bar when HP, MP, or your Pets HP are critically low (<=25%), when TP is ready to use (>=1000TP), or when a Target, Focus Target, or Sub Target has an SP ability active.
- Added Bar Drain animation options. Bar meter updates immediately as normal, while the newly "missing" part of the bar smoothly drains away.
- Added `show_target_lock` option. Indicates when you have your camera locked to your current target.
- Added `floating_tp_number` option. The TP number for the TP bar floats along with the end of the TP meter.
- Added `condense_target_name_and_sp_name` options. Rotates the name of the target and the SP ability name when a Target has an SP ability active, showing one at a time. Setting this to false will display the SP ability name after the target name.
- Added a real right-align for the Party Actions instead of the fake one that relied on a monospace font. Any font is able to be used now, with the minor tradeoff being if you turn it off it throws the positioning numbers way outta wack and will need to be readjusted.
- Added `ui` command. This will toggle the Screen Test that allows you to drag the different sections around the screen for placement.
- Added `icons` settings to change the different status icons.
- Added `italic` option for each section.
- Added `bar_bg` options under `colors`. Can now adjust the color of the background bar (`normal`). Also added colorizing the background bar when the target is dead (`dead`).
- Added a slight stroke/outline to all text to improve readability.
- Removed a number of commands that are either no longer needed (ie pos) or have been split into multiple sections (ie bold). Positions for the different bars have been split out into their own sections and can now be modified via drag and drop with the `ui` command. Bold and other settings are also split into each section now and can be modified in the settings file.
- Adjusted the meter bar resolution/granularity. Number of steps increased by 10 times, much more accurate meter bar lengths now.
- Adjusted the Self Action bar update polling from 10 to 50 times per second. Combined with the 10x meter bar steps adjustment this results in a noticeably smoother bar animation.
- Adjusted Target, Focus Target, and Sub Targets to no longer show active SP abilities once the target dies.
- Adjusted display of active SP ability on a mob to cancel if it is removed via Larceny.
- Adjusted the Fade option to not activate when player is dead.
- Fixed the `show_target_action_result` so that it actually does what it's supposed to do (literally created the option then never used it anywhere <_<;;).
- Fixed the SP Ability "Widened Compass" from not showing as activated.
- Fixed the name of a "player" weapon skill used by an enemy (ex. a Dyna Volte mob using Tachi: Fudo) being blinked/anticipated by a player being incorrectly labeled as a job ability.
- Known Issue: The name of a weapon skill used by a player being blinked by an enemy will be displayed incorrectly as a job ability.
- Known Issue: Bar dragging does not work properly if Window Mode is set to "Window" in Windower. It seems the window's title bar is included when Windower returns the position of the mouse, but is not included when placing a text object on screen, resulting in the numbers not quite matching up and needing to grab slightly below where the actual bar is on the screen in order to grab and drag it.
- Known Issue: The Target Lock icons/line very rarely will display incorrectly. A simple reload of the addon (`//lua r bars`) should fix the issue. I have done what I can to prevent this from happening, but `:extents()` occasionally just doesn't cooperate ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

Version 3.5
- Added `show_target_distance_colors` option. This will colorize the distance text based on the distance to the target and other factors. Accounts for Ranged Attacks (automatically detects and adjusts "hits squarely" and "strikes true" for shortbow, longbow, crossbow, gun, and throwing), Magic, Blue Magic (there are many many ranges for Blue so this has been distilled down to an inner and outer range covering most spells), Ninjutsu, Songs, and NPCs/objects. Distance calculations from the DistancePlus addon were used as the starting point and expanded from there.

Version 3.1.1

Version 3.1
- Added show_target_hex option. Shows the hex number of the current target. The Hex and Index options will override each other (only one or the other displayed at one time).

Version 3.0.3
- Fixed Enspell II's capitalizing incorrectly as "Enspell Ii" when showing the result of casting the spell.

Version 3.0.2
- Fixed an issue where setting show_self_action to false would give an error on load (thanks Github user asilva54!).
- Fixed an issue where setting show_self_action to false would still show the self action bar completing when the player action completes.

Version 3.0.1
- Fixed an issue where if the target of an AoE damage spell/ability resisted the spell, but the reast of the targets took damage, action results would show all as having resisted.
- Fixed missing "fails to take effect" message.

Version 3.0
- Added action results for many, many things.
- Added "Screen Test" for updating position, width, offset, size, and bold commands.
- Added abbreviate_common_mob_names option, abbreviates common mob names (Focus Target bar, Sub-Target bar, and Action Targets only, main Target bar will not abbreviate).
- Added color_spells option, colors spell names based on their element (previously colored them without having the option).
- Added fade_after_delay option. Fades out the bars after a set time delay of inaction.
- Added show_dyna_jobs option, shows jobs of Dynamis-D mobs on main Target bar.
- Added show_pet_distance option, displays distance between you and your pet on the Pet Bar.
- Added show_result_totals option, displays a count of targets hit by AoE's and cumulative result numbers for hitting multiple targets. Main target absorbing will take priority and show its single target absorb number.
- Added show_st_when_target option, displays the Sub-Target bar if it is the same as the Target.
- Added colors for damage and healing for action results. You can now tell when an action damages or heals a target by the color of the number. Removal type results (ie Dispel and Erase) also use the healing color.
- Added default entries for the auto focus target list (Aurix and NMs from Odyssey, Omen, Sortie, Vagary, and Domain Invasion).
- Adjusted the way the auto focus target add and remove commands work. You can now add or remove targets to the list by simply targeting them and using the add or remove cammands with no arguments (ex. target a mob and type `//bars a` will now add that target).
- Adjusted "finish" actions to update the table of all current actions happening at any given time the same way the "begin" actions do. This fixes an issue where the action results would not show correctly when the "begin" action packet was lost due to lag (Mireu, for example), even when the "finish" packet was still received.
- Adjusted the names of the Target, Sub Target, and Focus Target to be colored based on the subject, matching the bar coloring.

- Removed a few color settings that weren't used.
- Removed pet status from pet bar when on GEO.
- Fixed mobs claimed by an alliance member not coloring correctly.

- Fixed pet meter occasionally extending off the screen for a second when pet is called.
- Fixed paralyzed and intimidated melee attacks causing the Self Action bar to flash for 1 frame.
- Fixed padding issue with Self Action Bar at start of cast.
- Fixed TP bar not changing to correct color at exactly 1000 and 2000 TP.
- Fixed an issue where a target on the Auto Focus Target list flashes on the Focus Target Bar for a frame when it enters memory but before its actually within the focus_target_max_distance range (if set to below 50). This fix will make it disappear if you manage to stand exactly on top of it, but gl doing that.

Version 2.2.2
- Fixed Focus Target bar not updating when Override is used (`//bars f` command).
- Fixed Sub-Target x offset not updating when bar width is updated via in-game command.

Version 2.2.1
- Added missing 'No effect' message for monster abilities.

Version 2.2
- Added Focus Target Override. You can now use `//bars focus` (or `f` for short) to override the Auto Focus Target with whatever you have targeted. Override will be removed when subject moves out of range, dies (if its a mob), or is removed via `//bars focus` again.
- Added Sub-Target bar. Displayed as a half-length bar to the right of the Focus Target bar. New options to accompany this are `condense_target_and_subtarget_bars` and `char_width_multiplier` (to adjust horizontal spacing if needed).

- Fixed the show_roll_lucky_info option not working.

Version 2.0
- Overhauled the action tracking system. Now gives each action happening a tracking index number so that actions can overlap/replace eachother and reset the display timing for each player/mob when a new action starts. This allows actions to be displayed on-screen longer without worrying about a new action being removed early from the previous action.
- Overhauled the text shadows. They now line up correctly when parts of the action line are colored.
- Added optional Self Actions bar.
- Added optional Target Action Results (damage, buffs, resists, etc.).
- Added option to change the delay before clearing the action.
- Added option to show target distance.
- Added option to truncate target and action names (separately) to help with keeping the action line from getting too long.
- Added option to remove "Tachi: " and "Blade: " from weapon skill names to help with keeping the action line from getting too long.

- Fixed an issue where the text shadow occasionally does not line up correctly with its parent text.
- Fixed an error with the Pet bar that displays when logging.

Version 1.1
- Added Pet bar showing the name of the pet and their HPP. Defaults to displayed only for pet jobs, but can be turn on or off individually per job the same as HP/MP/TP.

Version 1.0
- First version
