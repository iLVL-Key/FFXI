## How To Setup
1. Load the addon with `//lua load bars`.
2. Type `//bars pos` and it will tell you the current position of the addon. You can then use `//bars pos # #` (where # represents an x and y position of your choosing) to move the base position of the addon around to where you would like it. Note that the position is where the Target bar is located, the other bars are then adjusted based on that.
3. Once you have the base position settled, you can add or remove any of the "player stat" bars using `//bars hp` (where 'hp' can be replaced with 'mp', 'tp', or 'pet' to add/remove those bars instead). Remember that the "player stat" bars displayed are specific to the job you are on.
4. If you have a different number of bars shown for different jobs and would like them aligned to the bottom (for example, sitting on top of your chat log), you can adjust the offset for each job using `//bars offset #` (where # represents how many pixels the addon will be adjusted up or down for that specific job).
#### Extra
5. You can type `//bars help` at any time to display the list of in game commands the addon supports. See **Commands** below.
6. Explore the `data/settings.xml` file to see the full list of options that are available to tweak. See **Options** below.

- Fixed missing "fails to take effect" message.

Version 3.0
- Added action results for many, many things.
- Added "Screen Test" for updating position, width, offset, size, and bold commands.
- Added abbreviate_common_mob_names option, abbreviates common mob names (Focus Target bar, Sub-Target bar, and Action Targets only, main Target bar will not abbreviate).

This fix will make it disappear if you manage to stand exactly on top of it, but gl doing that.

- Overhauled the text shadows. They now line up correctly when parts of the action line are colored.
- Added optional Self Actions bar.
- Added optional Target Action Results (damage, buffs, resists, etc.).
