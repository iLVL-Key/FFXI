# GaolPlan
(pronounced "*jail plan*")  

Helps players plan and optimize their approach to *Odyssey Gaol* runs. It provides a clean, mouse-driven interface for selecting bosses and assigning jobs across up to three Phones, ensuring no job is duplicated. With built-in save functionality, your most recent plans can be saved for easy reuse or adjustments, making it an ideal tool for static groups or coordinated runs.

# Commands
`//gaolplan` or `//gp` will bring up the GaolPlan window. That's it! The addon is otherwise entirely GUI-based.

# Limitations

- Save data does not save specific players, only the party member positions. If you load a save, take care to either use the party menu option to rearrange party members or adjust the jobs in the list to match the players.
