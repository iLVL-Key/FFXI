All of my Gearswap lua files utilize subtle sound effects found in the sounds folder. While not required, it is recommended to download the sounds folder and add it under the Gearswap/data folder to make full use of what the files offer.

The file structure should look like this:

`/addons/Gearswap/data/sounds/varioussoundfiles.wav`

`/addons/Gearswap/data/JOB.lua`
